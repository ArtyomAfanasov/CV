Dear Rakuten HR\\

Geo Adventures Inc.

Rakuten Crimson House, 1-14-1 Tamagawa, Setagaya-ku 

Tokyo 158-0094 \\

Dear Sir or Madam,\\

As a developer interested in building reliable global Internet services that touch hundreds of millions of users across the globe every day, I was glad to see your job offer for the position of web services projects. I have experience with solving software problems in products of SberKorus company that is included in the \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{TOP-20} largest IT suppliers according to CNews Analytics, 2018. I am positive I can help with Rakuten's upcoming challenges. \\

In my past position at SberKorus, I worked by the \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{scrum} methodology with \\ Electronic Data Interchange (\colorbox{cvsidecolor}{EDI}) on the main company project Esphere Courier (\colorbox{cvsidecolor}{REST API}) and some internal projects, fixing bugs, adding new functionality and refactoring \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{web services}. Here are examples of my work (included design, coding, code review, refactoring, test and release): 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Added processing of electronic documents and checking their validity for \\ a specific organization
    \item Added functionality to enhance an electronic signature, using C library, \\ marshalling. Development was carried out through \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{TDD}.
\end{itemize}

\\ During my term paper on the configuration of the \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{CI/CD} pipeline for the microservice architecture web application (my role in the project was DevOps) I have automated the entire pipeline (from committing to GitHub to running the application on the virual machine): commit, testing, building a docker-image, pushing the docker-image to DockerHub, connecting to a VM and creating a container. In this work I have used:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{Linux VM machines} \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{AWS} and \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{Microsoft Azure} for hosting and database services 
    \item \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{TeamCity} for pipeline configuration
    \item \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{Docker} for flexible delivery.
\end{itemize}

\\ Currently I work on Graduation project, related to \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{Java} application. \\

Rakuten's projects related to web services are a perfect match for my personal and professional interests and an exciting opportunity to create a scalable service and make it global to facilitate the transition of commerce to the Internet space. I would love to leverage my knowledge of software engineering to achieve significant results in Rakuten's projects.\\

Best regards,\\
Artyom Afanasov\\

P.S. During my other term paper I have received a job offer from my scientific supervisor, but I did not accept it as I was going to work on another project at another company in my fourth year at SPBU.\\

A little more about skills. I also have designed an SPBU course task database project and have written \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{SQL} code for it. In my position at SberKorus I used ORM for .NET and read SQL source code. Besides, I wrote on \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{Typescript} in SberKorus projects.\\
Thanks to the theory and tasks from Software Design SPBU course ("Linux bash" and "Roguelike game" architectures) I now have more experience in \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{software design}. And I have skills with \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{Linux} tools generally, for example, due to exploit work in the SPBU Information Security course. \\
I also have some \colorbox{cvsidecolor}{Python} programming skills related to math calculations.
